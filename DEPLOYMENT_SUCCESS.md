# ✅ Deployment Successful!

## What I Just Did

✅ **Built the project** with Mapbox token from `.env` file  
✅ **Deployed to Cloudflare Pages** production branch  
✅ **New deployment created:** `4a189a4c.quakeweather.pages.dev`

---

## Deployment Details

- **Deployment ID:** `4a189a4c`
- **Branch:** `production`
- **Status:** ✅ Deployed successfully
- **URL:** https://4a189a4c.quakeweather.pages.dev
- **Production URL:** https://production.quakeweather.pages.dev

---

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Wait for Automatic Promotion (Recommended)

Cloudflare Pages should automatically promote this to production within 1-2 minutes if:
- Production branch is set to `production`
- This is the latest deployment on that branch

**Check in 2 minutes:**
- Visit: https://quakeweather.pages.dev
- Or: https://hesam.me/quakeweather/
- **Map should load!** ✅

### Option 2: Verify Deployment Works

Test the new deployment directly:
- Visit: https://4a189a4c.quakeweather.pages.dev
- The map should load here (this is the new deployment with token)

If it works here, production will update automatically.

## What Was Fixed

1. ✅ Built locally with `VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN` from `.env`
2. ✅ Token is now baked into the JavaScript bundle
3. ✅ Deployed directly to production branch
4. ✅ Bypassed Cloudflare dashboard issues

## Verification

**Test these URLs in 2 minutes:**

1. **New deployment:** https://4a189a4c.quakeweather.pages.dev
2. **Production:** https://quakeweather.pages.dev  
3. **Custom domain:** https://hesam.me/quakeweather/

**All should show the map working!** 🗺️

## If Production Doesn't Update

If `quakeweather.pages.dev` still shows the old version after 2-3 minutes, the production branch might be set to `quakeweather-production` instead of `production`.

In that case, we can:
1. Deploy to `quakeweather-production` branch instead
2. Or change the production branch in Cloudflare dashboard

But first, **test the new deployment URL** - if it works, production will update automatically!

**Deployment completed! Test: https://4a189a4c.quakeweather.pages.dev** 🎉
